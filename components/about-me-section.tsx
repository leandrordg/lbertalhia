            I&apos;m Leandro Bertalhia. I live in SÃ£o Paulo, where I create
            digital solutions for the future.
          </h1>

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            I&apos;ve always had a passion for creating things, and I wrote my
            first program at the age of 16. From there, my fascination with
            technology grew, and I dove deep into web development, mastering
            tools like Next.js, TypeScript, and AWS. Over the years, I&apos;ve
            worked on everything from building complex e-commerce platforms to
            optimizing backend services, and even creating real-time
            collaborative applications.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Beyond web development, I&apos;ve always been interested in solving
            technical problems and improving system efficiency. My experience
            extends beyond software, encompassing electrical maintenance and
            automation, which has given me a broader understanding of
            technology. This knowledge has allowed me to create robust and
            efficient solutions, combining hardware and software to solve
            real-world challenges.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Along the way, I&apos;ve gained experience working on diverse
            projects, from helping improve operational efficiency at Suzano
            Papel e Celulose to launching my own ventures. Every project I take
            on is an opportunity to push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible
            with technology, and I&apos;m always looking forward to the next
            challenge.
